1.  **Download Setup:** This is where you add links, manage the download queue, and choose where to save your files.
2.  **Options:** Here, you can customize the quality, format, and other content to be downloaded.
3.  **Activity Log:** Displays notifications about the download process, allowing you to monitor the program's activities.

## **II. Step-by-Step Download Guide**

Follow these simple steps to download the content you want:

#### **Step 1: Add a Video/Playlist/Channel Link**
* Copy the link of the YouTube video, playlist, or channel you want to download.
* Paste the link into the **"Channel/Playlist/Video Link"** field.
* Click the **"➕ Add"** button. The link will be added to the **"Queue"** table below.
> **Tip:** You can add multiple links to the queue before starting the download.

#### **Step 2: Preview (Optional for Playlists/Channels)**
* If you paste a link to a playlist or channel, you can click the **"🔍 Preview..."** button.
* A new window will appear, listing all the videos in that playlist/channel.
* You can select one or more specific videos from the list to add to the queue, instead of downloading the entire collection.

#### **Step 3: Select a Save Directory**
* In the **"Save directory"** line, click the **"📂 Browse..."** button.
* A window will open, allowing you to browse and select a folder on your computer where you want to save the downloaded files.

#### **Step 4: Customize Options (If Needed)**
* **Quality:** Select the desired video resolution (e.g., 1080p, 720p).
* **Limit:** If it's a playlist/channel, you can limit the number of videos to download (set to `0` to download all).
* **Video Type:** Choose between "Regular Videos" and "Shorts".
* **Concurrent downloads:** Select the number of videos to download simultaneously (this can speed up the process).
* **Other Options:**
  * **🎵 Audio Only:** Downloads only the audio file (MP3).
  * **⏩ Skip Video & Audio:** Downloads only auxiliary content like thumbnails or subtitles.
  * **🖼️ Download Thumbnail:** Downloads the video's thumbnail image (in .jpg format).
  * **📝 Download Subtitles:** Downloads the subtitle file (if available).

#### **Step 5: Start Downloading**
* Once everything is set up, click the **"🚀 Start Download"** button in the **Controls** section.
* The download process will begin. You can monitor the progress of each video in the "Progress" column and see detailed messages in the "Activity Log".

#### **Step 6: Stop Downloading**
* If you want to stop the process, click the **"⏹️ Stop"** button.

## **III. Advanced Features**

In the top-right corner of the window, you'll find advanced function buttons:
* **Language Buttons (EN, VI, ZH, ...):** Click to change the interface language instantly.
* **Cookie Settings:** Useful for downloading videos that require a login, are private, or are age-restricted. You can use a browser extension to get the cookie file and load it into the program.
* **Proxy Settings:** Use this when you want to download videos that are blocked in your geographical region.
* **Update Library:** Click this button to have the program automatically download the latest version of the `yt-dlp` tool. This ensures better compatibility with YouTube's changes.
* **Buy me a coffee ☕:** If you find this tool helpful, please support the author to provide more motivation for development!

Enjoy using the tool!

## **IV. Creator Thumbnail and Video Tools**

This repository includes source-image-driven tooling for short-form video
packages. It uses a local creator-owned photo or video frame, rather than
shipping unrelated placeholder visuals.

* Use [`scripts/generate_video_assets.py`](scripts/generate_video_assets.py) to generate a thumbnail SVG, captions, edit brief, and optional FFmpeg render helper from a local JPEG, PNG, or WebP image.
* Use [`scripts/optimize_images.py`](scripts/optimize_images.py) to resize, compress, and optionally convert local image assets to WebP before publishing them on a website or social platform.
* See [`content/short-video-and-thumbnail-guide.md`](content/short-video-and-thumbnail-guide.md) for challenge and cat short scripts, thumbnail copy, and source-image package commands.

Example video and thumbnail generation command:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_video_assets.py path/to/reference.jpg --type challenge --output-dir assets/generated
```

Example image optimization command:

```bash
python3 scripts/optimize_images.py ./assets --output-dir ./optimized-images --max-width 1280 --quality 82 --format webp
```
